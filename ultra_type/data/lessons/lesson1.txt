Once upon a time in a small village, there lived a man named Bob who was known for his forgetfulness. One day, Bob decided to bake a cake for his wife's birthday. He meticulously followed the recipe, but in his usual style, he forgot one minor detail - turning on the oven.
After waiting for an hour, Bob opened the oven, only to find a perfectly raw cake. Scratching his head, he suddenly had a "brilliant" idea. He remembered seeing a documentary about penguins living in extreme cold. "If penguins can bake in the cold, why can't cakes?" he thought.
Determined, Bob put the cake outside in the snow, hoping the cold would somehow bake it. The villagers watched in amusement as Bob checked on his cake every hour, shivering but hopeful. By evening, not only was the cake still raw, it had become a new playground for the local squirrels.
Realizing his mistake, Bob burst into laughter along with the villagers. His wife, amused by the whole spectacle, said, "Well, at least you've invented a new dessert, 'Frozen Cake Ã  la Squirrel'!"
From that day on, Bob's 'Cold-Baked Cake' became a legendary joke in the village, and he never forgot to turn on the oven again.
